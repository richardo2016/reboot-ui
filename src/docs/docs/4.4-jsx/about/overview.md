## Team

Bootstrap is maintained by a [small team of developers](https://github.com/orgs/twbs/people) on GitHub, [RebootUI](https://github.com/richardo2016/reboot-ui) is one (p)react UI library based on Bootstrap's style.

By now, [RebootUI] is just one personal library for [richardo2016](https://github.com/richardo2016), if you have any question about usage/development of it, just [post one new issue](https://github.com/richardo2016/reboot-ui/issues/new).
