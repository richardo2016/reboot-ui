While the styling of badges provides a visual cue as to their purpose, these users will simply be presented with the content of the badge. Depending on the specific situation, these badges may seem like random additional words or numbers at the end of a sentence, link, or button.</p>\n<p>Unless the context is clear (as with the &quot;Notifications&quot; example, where it is understood that the &quot;4&quot; is the number of notifications), consider including additional context with a visually hidden piece of additional text.</p>\n<div class=\"bd-example\">\n<button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">\n  Profile <span class=\"badge badge-light\">9</span>\n  <span class=\"sr-only\">unread messages</span>\n</button>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"contextual-variations\">Contextual variations</h2>\n<p>Add any of the below mentioned modifier classes to change the appearance of a badge.</p>\n<div class=\"bd-example\">\n\n<p><span class=\"badge badge-primary\">Primary</span>\n<span class=\"badge badge-secondary\">Secondary</span>\n<span class=\"badge badge-success\">Success</span>\n<span class=\"badge badge-danger\">Danger</span>\n<span class=\"badge badge-warning\">Warning</span>\n<span class=\"badge badge-info\">Info</span>\n<span class=\"badge badge-light\">Light</span>\n<span class=\"badge badge-dark\">Dark</span></p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"bd-callout bd-callout-warning\"><h5 id=\"conveying-meaning-to-assistive-technologies\">Conveying meaning to assistive technologies</h5>\n<p>Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies â€“ such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the <code>.sr-only</code> class.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"pill-badges\">Pill badges</h2>\n<p>Use the <code>.badge-pill</code> modifier class to make badges more rounded (with a larger <code>border-radius</code> and additional horizontal <code>padding</code>).
